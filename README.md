# ⚠️ Release v1.0.0 – It's Basically the macOS Calculator (But Worse)

This is **not** the next big thing. It's a Qt6-based calculator that looks like a macOS clone — because it basically is.  
But hey, it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that’s something.

## Why Would You Want This?

You probably don’t.  
Unless you:
- Miss the macOS Calculator on other platforms
- Want something with pretty icons
- Just like collecting calculator apps for some reason

---

## Features (If You Care)

- **Looks kinda nice** – transparency and all that
- **Cross-platform** – at least it runs on your OS
- **Real-time expression preview** – not unique, just useful
- **Font Awesome icons** – because native ones weren’t fancy enough
- **"Native look"** – subjectively close, depending on your definition of native

## 💻 Build Instructions

If you're still interested for some reason, here’s how to build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
cd calculator
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh build
```
Or just download the binaries from the Releases page. It’s faster. And probably smarter.

## 🚫 Known Issues
	-	It tries too hard to look like macOS
	-	You might regret installing it
	-	Probably better alternatives already exist

## 🧪 Why This Exists
It was a fun Qt + C++20 experiment.
That’s all.
Use it if you want, or don’t.
No pressure.
